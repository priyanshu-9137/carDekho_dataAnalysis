CarDekho Dataset Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the CarDekho dataset, which contains various features related to cars listed on the CarDekho platform. The analysis aims to uncover valuable insights regarding car prices, fuel types, kilometers driven, and more. The dataset includes various attributes such as the car's brand name, present price, selling price, fuel type, kilometers driven, and ownership details.

Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to explore the relationships and patterns within the dataset, with a focus on understanding how factors like fuel type, ownership, and kilometers driven impact the selling price of cars. Key analyses include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values,  and formatting issues.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understand trends and distributions in the dataset.

Key Insights and Analysis
Distribution of Car Prices:

An exploration of both the selling price and present price of cars, showing their distributions across the dataset.

Kilometers Driven:

An analysis of the distribution of the number of kilometers driven by the cars listed for sale.

Most Common Car Types:

A breakdown of the most frequent Car Names in the dataset, highlighting popular car brands and models.

Fuel Type Distribution:

Analysis of the fuel types used in the cars, along with the distribution of cars based on fuel type.

Price vs. Present Price Relationship:

Exploration of the relationship between the present price and selling price of the cars.

Kilometers Driven and Selling Price:

Investigation into how the number of kilometers driven influences the selling price of the cars.

Fuel Type and Selling Price:

Comparison of the average selling price of cars based on their fuel type, determining which fuel type tends to have the highest prices.

Seller Type Distribution:

Distribution of cars sold by seller type (Individual vs. Dealer) and its impact on pricing.

Ownership Impact on Selling Price:

Analysis of how the ownership status (first, second, third, etc.) of a car influences its selling price.

Average Selling Price by Year:

Calculation of the average selling price of cars for each year, helping to understand price trends over time.

Kilometers Driven by Fuel Type:

Comparison of kilometers driven across different fuel types, identifying trends based on fuel efficiency.

Median Selling Price by Fuel Type:

Median selling price for cars based on fuel type, providing insight into the central tendency of prices.

Outliers in Selling Price Based on Kilometers Driven:

Identification of outliers in selling prices based on the number of kilometers driven, helping to spot unusually high or low values.

Present Price and Seller Type:

Exploration of the relationship between present price and seller type to uncover any significant patterns.

Dataset Information
The dataset includes the following key features:

Car_Name: The name of the car.

Fuel_Type: The fuel type used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.).

Seller_Type: The type of seller (Individual or Dealer).

Transmission: The type of transmission (Manual or Automatic).

Owner: Number of previous owners.

Present_Price: The current price of the car.

Selling_Price: The price at which the car is being sold.

Kilometers_Driven: The number of kilometers driven by the car.

Year: The manufacturing year of the car.

Key Findings
Car Price Distribution: The distribution of car prices revealed certain trends, with most cars falling within a mid-price range.

Fuel Type Impact: Cars with Diesel engines tend to have higher selling prices on average compared to Petrol and CNG cars.

Kilometers Driven Effect: As expected, cars with higher kilometers driven generally have lower selling prices.

Ownership and Price: Cars with fewer owners tend to have a higher selling price on average.

Seller Type Influence: Cars sold by dealers tend to have higher selling prices compared to individual sellers.
